## Overview
This portfolio serves as a digital resume and project showcase. It’s tailored to highlight my technical skills and real-world experience, with a focus on cybersecurity, data science, and full-stack web development. The design is tech-inspired— Churches, bold colors (teal, gold, and neon green) create a cohesive, professional look, while subtle animations (like the typewriter effect) add flair without overwhelming the user.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens with a hamburger menu for smaller devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects on buttons, links, and social icons; tooltips for social links and tools; a typewriter animation in the hero section.
- **Clean UI**: Unified color palette (teal `#008080`, gold `#ffd700`, dark gray `#2e2e2e`, off-white `#f8f9fa`) with neon green (`#32CD32`) accents.

  - Hero section with a punchy tagline: "Building secure, smart solutions with code."
  - About me section with a concise bio.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to run the portfolio locally or deploy it:

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- (Optional) A text editor like VS Code for customization.
- (Optional) Git for version control.

### Steps
1. **Clone or Download**:
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/bbrnn/your-repo-name.git` (replace with your repo URL if hosted).
   - Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Open Locally**:
   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Open `index.html` in your browser (e.g., right-click and select "Open with Chrome").

3. **Deploy (Optional)**:
   - Host on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or AWS S3:
     - **GitHub Pages**: Push to a `gh-pages` branch or the main branch with a GitHub Pages setting enabled.
     - **Netlify**: Drag the folder into Netlify’s dropzone or link your Git repo.
     - **AWS S3**: Upload files to an S3 bucket and configure it for static website hosting.

4. **Test**:
   - Check responsiveness by resizing the browser or using developer tools (F12 → mobile view).
   - Verify links (GitHub, Medium, socials) and the contact form (`https://formspree.io/f/mzzejokj`).

## Customization
Make it your own with these tweaks:
- **Content**: Update `index.html` with your latest projects, skills, or bio.
- **Colors**: Modify the palette in `style.css` (e.g., change `#008080` to another primary color).
- **Fonts**: Swap Google Fonts in the `<head>` (e.g., replace `Roboto` with `Open Sans`).
- **Images**: Replace `dev-2.png` with your photo (optimize for web, <500KB).
- **Resume**: Update `Bridget-Ngugi-Resume.pdf` and ensure the link matches.
- **Form**: Replace the Formspree URL (`https://formspree.io/f/mzzejokj`) with your own endpoint.

Example CSS tweak (change primary color):
```css
header, footer, .contact-form button {
  background-color: #newcolor; /* e.g., #1a73e8 */
}
```
